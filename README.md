# SMS-Assistant
Get quick internet answers to questions via SMS -- useful in off-grid emergencies.

# Motivation
I came up with this idea while on a camping trip in the Ashley National Forest, Utah. My SUV had started showing transmission issues and my Chilton manual did not have the information I needed. I had no internet service on my phone, but I did have a single bar of SMS cell service. I imagined how useful it would be if I could text a question to Google and get some results back.

In the end I texted my mother to look things up for me, but a response did not come until morning, which is why a computer system would be good to have in a situation like this. If you are wondering, I was able to fix my transmission issues and get home safely to write this.
